# Matplotlib_challenge
Analyzing the data of mice and their drug trials for reducing tumor size


### Notes and 'citations'

- I used a lot of help from AskBCS and the TA's for this one. Much of the code was written by me but specific sections, like the for-loop regarding the box-plot graph, were very much 'written' by the tutors as they guided the process, even if I technically did the typing.
- As well, there are pieces of code that I lifted directly from some of the assignemnts we went through in the matplotlob activities, such as the 4 lines of code designed for the calculation of what could be considered and outlier. The linear regression code was adapted directly from an activity as well. These seemed to be the correct way to do them and I chose to spend time on concepts I needed to refine rather than re-tread ground already covered and readily available for me to use. In the real world, reusing code is efficient and encouraged.
- There may be other instances of code from assignments as well, but those were the major ones.
